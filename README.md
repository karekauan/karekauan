## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kauan AntonyÃª Costa, I'm 18 years old and I went to high school
with a Computer Technician course at the Instituto Federal do ParanÃ¡ - IFPR(Cascavel)
and I intend to join the same institution for the higher course of Technology in Systems Analysis and Development,
I also want to pursue a career in the IT field and I'm studying some of the consequences of this one to see which one I most identify with.

# ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

I'm currently focusing on getting to know the tools in the DevOps area
so I'm just doing simple projects for functionality testing,
my last consistent project was a CRUD using a login interface
and other functions made in PyQt and linked with a Sqlite database.

# ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:

After seeing a little about the front and back end area in web programming, having a Restful API as a more solid project,
I recently started studying about the role and tools of a DevOps.
I'm taking an intensive course in the area with a focus on Dockers,
Kubernets, Terraform and others. The first project I did in the area was an api using
MySql, Node.js and PHP, which are properly separated into containers to simulate a working environment
where it is possible to avoid differences in tool versions between different machines.
After acquiring a decent level of knowledge in this area, I intend to restart studies in the area of
cybersecurity that, despite having interested me for a few years, demanded a minimum knowledge in other
areas that I came to acquire during high school, allowing me to return to studies now.
